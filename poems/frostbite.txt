> Once was a queen throned up high
> A crown would twinkle up in the sky
> Now and then would stoop down low
> And bless all peasants with her glow 
>
> One day, by night, was another visit, 
> A lost soul felt something exquisite,
> That day, that night, something did start
> A glow of light shun right from her heart
>
> A room full of people, all disappeared
> Focused on each other, mind cleared
> Their new formed friendship arose by dawn
> And the queen's plan, to go back home, gone
>
> Day by day, warmer she would get
> And slowly, her guard down she'd let
> But that peasant wasn't at all perfect,
> And often he did act quite incorrect.
>
> Apparently that peasant, he did not learn
> The queen got tired, and decided to return
> And thus, back home the queen went again
> All the love between them gone in vain
>
> The peasant left in sorrow, all alone,
> While above him, an ice queen's throne
> Her heart was dried by a single frostbite
> Under all that ice, hides her heart's light
>
> Behind the clouds, she's hiding herself
> While he's down there, fighting himself
> To lose each other, how foolish could they be
> Their hearts were glowing, yet they did not see
