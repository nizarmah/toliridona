> you stumbled upon a path; quite indifferent from mine
> ahead of you a psychopath; but between us no line
>
> you stared for some time; asking questions over and over
> you answered some of mine; was tangled in a crossover
>
> slowly you showed me more; and i felt so attached
> with your eyes and snore; a cold heart you snatched
>
> taken by your care and love; the impact that you smeared
> destroyed by your compliments; expectations had me seared
>
> beauty, let it be clear; a cursed prince i am not
> when your lips get near; no prince'll take my spot
>
> might call it a fantasy; like beauty and the beast
> sadly, ends different for me; the ugly never ceased
