> Dear my darling, snow keeps falling
> I know it hurts, I can hear you hauling
>
> But after a while, the snow does melt
> Yes it goes away, not the hurt it dealt
> 
> And life goes on, yet it still feels new
> Everytime it happens, it gets to you
> 
> But the sun stays, it never does leave
> You can feel it shining, even during eve
> 
> It hurts you, but rest is of relief
> Darling, do not replace love with grief
