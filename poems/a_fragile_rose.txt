# A Fragile Rose
# Wednesday April 10, 2018
#
> a rose, beautiful, but all covered with thorns
> nourishes itself in rain, and alone it mourns
> never let anyone near, hurt those who got close
> thorns many did fear; theres more to her than flaws
>
> shes loves the rain, this rose enjoys being cold
> she likes to stay closed, this rose is quite bold
> but day after day the rose opens, letting the light in
> while threads of light are also shining from within
>
> she got used to standing alone, with sun or snow
> even when broken, weakness she never did show
> fallen petals, broken stem and thorns, oh her glow
> god sent an angel to a world of sinners down below
>
> infront of the rose, here i am putting my hand out
> not fearing the thorns, know what she's all about
> not afraid of her, she knows i don't fear the pain
> but her thorns cut deep, they make me go insane
>
> i just hope she doesn't fear me
> hope my care she can feel n' see
> she might lose some petals with me
> but i will be here to nurture her
> to see the petals grow back slowly
