# A Rose Against the Winds
# Tuesday May 14, 2019
#
> storms far, and storms near; a little garden had no fear
> three flowers standing strong; behind one, two other young
>
> winds from more than one side; no place for the young to hide
> scared, one's doubt thinned; a rose arose against the winds
>
> eldest, she was big and tall; petals red, prettier than all
> winds, thick petals could bare; storm blowing left by despair
>
> storm after storm; stronger she grew
> with colder petals; covered with dew
> yet when the moon is absent at night
> the petals the glow, oh, red so bright
> the moon is hidden deep in her heart
